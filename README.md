# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLTK

## Overview
This project utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Twitter API access (optional, if using real-time Twitter data)

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install NLTK by running `pip install nltk`.
3. Download NLTK data by running Python and executing the following commands:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have access to Twitter data. You can either use pre-existing datasets or access real-time data using the Twitter API. If using the Twitter API, you'll need to set up a Twitter Developer account and obtain API keys.
3. Modify the `twitter_sentiment_analysis.py` script to suit your needs. You may need to change the data source (file or API) and adjust any preprocessing steps or analysis methods.
4. Run the `twitter_sentiment_analysis.py` script to perform sentiment analysis on the Twitter data.
5. Analyze the results to gain insights into the sentiment expressed in the Twitter data.
